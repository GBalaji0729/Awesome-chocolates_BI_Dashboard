**Insights:**

 
- Products like *Organic Choco Syrup* and *Smooth Silky Salty* are both high in sales and profitability, suggesting they are core products with loyal customers or strong market fit.
- our top-selling people are highlighted.
- The high revenue ($141M) and strong profit margin indicate that the business is financially healthy with efficient cost management. Still, we can observe there is a dip in the overall sales as compared to the previous year.
- India, being the top region (40m) indicates strong local demand. However, **Canada and the UK** show very low sales.
